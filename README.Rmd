## Overview

**MIDASpy** is a Python class for multiply imputing missing data using MIDAS, a deep learning method based on denoising autoencoder neural networks. The **MIDASpy** algorithm offers significant accuracy and efficiency advantages over other multiple imputation strategies, particularly when applied to large datasets with complex features. In addition to implementing the algorithm, the class contains functions for processing data before and after model training, running imputation model diagnostics, generating multiple completed datasets, and estimating regression models on these datasets.

For an implementation in R, see our **rMIDAS** repository [here](https://github.com/MIDASverse/rMIDAS).

## Background on MIDAS

For more information on the MIDAS method, see:

Lall, Ranjit, and Thomas Robinson. 2020. “Applying the MIDAS Touch: How to Handle Missing Values in Large and Complex Data.” APSA Preprints. https://doi.org/10.33774/apsa-2020-3tk40-v3

## Installation

To install via pip, input the following command into the terminal:  
`pip install MIDASpy`

The latest development version (potentially unstable) can be installed via the terminal with:
`pip install git+https://github.com/MIDASverse/MIDASpy.git`

MIDAS requires:

* Python (>=3.5; <3.9)
* Numpy (>=1.5)
* Pandas (>=0.19)
* Tensorflow (>= 1.10) -- **TensorFlow>=2.2 now fully supported**
* Matplotlib
* TensorFlow Addons (>=0.11 if using Tensorflow >= 2.2)

Tensorflow also has a number of requirements, particularly if GPU acceleration is desired. See https://www.tensorflow.org/install/ for details.

## Example

For a simple demonstration of **MIDASpy**, see our Jupyter Notebook [example](https://github.com/MIDASverse/MIDASpy/blob/master/Examples/midas_demo.ipynb). 

## Version 1.1.1 (October 2020)

*v1.1.1 fixes a minor dependency bug.*

Update adds **full Tensorflow 2.X support**:

* Users can now run the MIDAS algorithm in TensorFlow 2.X (TF1 support retained)

* Tidier handling of random seed setting across both TensorFlow and NumPy

* Minor bug fixes


## Version 1.0.2 (September 2020)

*v1.0.2 patches MIDASpy to allow for packaging to PyPi, and updates the package name.*

Key changes in 1.0:

* Minor, mainly cosmetic, changes to the underlying source code.
* Renamed 'categorical_columns' argument in build_model() to 'binary_columns' to avoid confusion
* Added plotting arguments to overimputation() method to suppress intermediary overimputation plots (plot_main) and all plots (skip_plot).
* Changed overimputation() plot titles, labels and legends
* Added tensorflow 2.0 version check on import
* Fixed seed-setting bug in earlier versions


Previous versions
-----------------

*Alpha 0.2:*

Variational autoencoder enabled. More flexibility in model specification, although defaulting to a simple mirrored system. Deeper analysis tools within .overimpute() for checking fit on continuous values. Constructor code deconflicted. Individual output specification enabled for very large datasets.

Key added features:

* Variational autoencoder capacity added, including encoding to and sampling from latent space

Planned features:

* Time dependence handling through recurrent cells
* Improving the pipeline methods for very large datasets
* Tensorboard integration
* Dropout scaling
* A modified constructor that can generate embeddings for better interpolation of features
* R support

Wish list:

* Smoothing for time series (LOESS?)
* Informative priors?

*Alpha 0.1:*

* Basic functionality feature-complete.
* Support for mixed categorical and continuous data types
* An "additional data" pipeline, allowing data that may be relevant to the imputation to be included (without being included in error generating statistics)
* Simplified calibration for model complexity through the "overimputation" function, including visualization of reconstructed features
* Basic large dataset functionality
